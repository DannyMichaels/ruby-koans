# There's no place like Ruby

This morning we will be working on the following: 

1. [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)

This will give you the opportunity to learn Ruby syntax, as well as getting used to using automated testing. As you go through this exercise, you should be Googling liberally to help you understand concepts. The [Ruby docs are here](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/).


## Getting Started

Make sure you read everything on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) homepage. Under "The Path to Enlightenment" are instructions on how you will proceed. We'll be going through the first few in class to get you started. 

Fork and clone this repo.

- Download Ruby Koans into the directory for this repo. Run the path_to_enlightenment.rb and start hacking.

- Try to get as far as you can. Some of the later concepts we have not covered however the testing should steer you in the right direction.

- You can ask for help if you get stuck but please do your best to figure these out on your own. The path to enlightenment is acheivable even with no prior knowledge of Ruby.

- You will add a screen cap of your terminal to your repo showing that you've gotten to the end of the koans. Link to the image in your pull request comment. Something like this:
