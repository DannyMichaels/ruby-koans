This exercise we will be working on the following: 

1. [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)

This will give you the opportunity to learn Ruby syntax, as well as getting used to using automated testing. As you go through this exercise, you should be Googling liberally to help you understand concepts. The [Ruby docs are here](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/).


## Getting Started

Make sure you read everything on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) homepage. Under "The Path to Enlightenment" are instructions on how you will proceed. We'll be going through the first few in class to get you started. 

Fork and clone this repo.

- Download Ruby Koans into the directory for this repo. Run the path_to_enlightenment.rb and start hacking.

- Some of the later concepts we have not covered, but use the testing to your advantage. It will steer you in the right direction.

- You can ask for help if you get stuck but please do your best to figure these out on your own. The path to enlightenment is acheivable even with no prior knowledge of Ruby.

- Complete 156 Koans. Run `pwd` to print your file path, including your root directory. Then, screen cap your terminal, showing your progress and your `pwd` command. Link to the image in your pull request comment. Something like this `![screen cap](https://i.imgur.com/x48fCZf.png)` will display:
